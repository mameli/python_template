## Quickstart

### 1. Install `uv`

This project uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as package manager.
Installation instructions are [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
It's recommended to install the latest version from [github releases](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases).


Linux/MacOS (bash):
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Windows (powershell):
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

If you have already installed `uv`, please ensure you're using the latest version by running `uv self update`.
